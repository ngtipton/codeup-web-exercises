    Note: Ignore this, I was just taking notes in class and didn't know this would actually be the exercise name.

    var num = 1;

    if (1 == num) {
        console.log ("it is 1");
    }

        This makes it console log "it is 1" if the number 1 equals the variable num, which was defined as 1.

    if (1 !== num) {
        console.log ("it is not 1");
    }

        This makes the console log write a different statement if 1 is not equal to the variable num.  A good example of
        this is when the num variable was changed to something else (like 2).

        if checks for true statements, else checks for false statements.

    var color = '';

    if (color == 'green') {
        console.log('go');
    }

    if (color == 'yellow') {
        console.log('slow');
    }

    if (color == 'red') {
        console.log('stop');
    }

        Once you define the color variable, then the if functions below it will determine which one it is and gives you
        the console log that corresponds to the specified color.

    if (color == 'green') {
        console.log('go');
    } else if (color == 'yellow') {
        console.log('slow');
    } else if (color == 'red') {
        console.log('stop');
    } else {
        console.log('blink');
    }

        This is a better way of writing the code, because it shows all the functions have to something to do with one
        specific thing.  Makes it more readable and understandable.

        Only use else for black and white functions.  It there are more than three options, use else if.

        For else statements, you don't put anything after it.

    if (color == 'green') {
        console.log('go');
    } else if (color == 'yellow') {
        console.log('slow');
    } else {
        console.log('stop');
    }

        This use of else means that any color other than green or yellow will send out a console log that says "stop".

    if (showered) {
        console.log ('you smell good');
    }   else {
        console.log ('you smell funny');
    }

        The above is a black and white statement/function.

    var smell = (showered === true) ? "good" : "funny";

    console.log("You smell " + smell);

        This is a shortened version of the black and white statement/function above.  If showered variable is is true,
        then the left statement ("good") will be used.  If the showered variable is false, then the right statement
        ("funny") will be used.  The console log have the "You smell " already in it to add the smell variable and make
        the sentence complete.

    var showered = false;
    var soapUsed = false;

    if (showered) {
        if (soapUsed === true){
            console.log ('you smell good');
        }
    }   else {
        console.log ('you smell funny');
    }

        This if within an if checks another variable on top of the original variable to determine if the statement is
        true.

    color = prompt("Give me a color");

    switch (color) {
        case "green":
            console.log('go');
            break;
        case "yellow":
            console.log('slow');
            break;
        case "red":
            console.log('stop');
            break;
        default:
            console.log('blink');
    }

        This is a switch statement that does the same thing as our if else language above.  The teacher said it is
        preferable to use switch for 3 and above choices.

    switch (color.toLowerCase()) {}

        The .toLowerCase() will convert whatever is input into lower case letters and then submits it.
